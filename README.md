# Multiplayer Game Management System

## Overview

This project consists of a comprehensive system for managing real-time multiplayer games. It includes a frontend React hook, `useGameHandlerClient`, and a backend `GameHandler` class. Together, they provide a full-stack solution for creating, joining, managing, and handling real-time interactions in multiplayer game environments.

## Features

- **Real-time Communication**: Utilizes Socket.io for real-time communication between clients and the server.
- **Game Lifecycle Management**: Supports creating, joining, starting, and finishing game sessions.
- **Event Handling**: Facilitates emitting and responding to game-related events, enhancing the interactive experience.
- **Client and Server Synchronization**: Ensures that game state and player actions are consistently synchronized between the client and server.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms to manage edge cases and ensure a smooth gaming experience.

## Documentation

Detailed technical documentation is available for both the frontend hook and the backend game handler:

- **Frontend Hook (`useGameHandlerClient`)**: For a detailed explanation of the hook's functionality, usage, and features, refer to the documentation available at `documentation/hook.md`.
- **Backend (`GameHandler`)**: Comprehensive information about the backend game handling, including setup, event management, and error handling, can be found at `documentation/backend.md`.
